Recommendation engines work on a simple but effective principle: "During browsing, the user's attention (and his money) is up for grabs." Web based markets work best with these engines as they maximizes the likelihood of a transaction or boost advertising. These engines are in essence complex information filters that attempt at showing the user something compelling enough to pursue. The complexity of the recommendation problem is due to that vast space of possibilities that can be exploited.Our goal is to explore this difficult yet rewarding problem in our project Î¼REn (read as Mu-ren) by building our own Music REcommendation ENgine.
